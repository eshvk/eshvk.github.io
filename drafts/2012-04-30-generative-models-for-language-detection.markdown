A good part of my childhood was spent in the English countryside. This is both true and not. I lived in a tiny rapidly disintegrating colony of Indians; mentally and physically separate from the Ethiopia outside: famines, wars and AIDS. My parents held fast onto an almost mythical India: stories, broken toys and kitsch art. So reality was a surreal thing where playmates would occasionally disappear -- migrating back to this strange land called India or "disappeared" for supporting the wrong government. In someways, this made it easier to accept all the prose that I read: English pastoral scenes filled with rabbits, hayfields, blueberries and scones; things for all I knew existed in the same world where my childhood playmates had gone to.
