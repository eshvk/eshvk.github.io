Daisies. Three months ago, I finally linked the word to the flower. Both I was
familiar with separately. I had been trying to be more mindful. Suddenly, one
day, during a run in the panhandle, I saw them everywhere. Flowers that
I grew up with. In my house in Addis Ababa; in the kindergarten backyard. I had
plucked them, crushed their petals, tried to grow them. Yet, they were
not mine. They were ordinary, things of no stories. Like me, they were part of a formless society of nomads. The 
people who brought them had disappeared. No one knew what they called them; what memories those flowers held for them. 
The Ethiopians merely called them _ababa_ (Amharic for flower).  

On a whim, I took a picture, asked someone. Daisies. A word I knew. I saw it in poems, books. The school 
that I went to taught about them. An Indian school with English roots. To me, the word was as fantastic as pixie or fairy. Meaningless. Now, it had meaning. 
I connected the mythology to the reality. It felt more real. 

In [Jasmine][jasmineamz], Naipaul, a man from another halfmade formless society, talks about this problem. 

 > The language was ours, to use as we pleased. The literature that came with it was therefore of peculiar authority; 
 > but this literature was like an alien mythology. There was, for instance, Wordsworth's notorious poem about the daffodil. 
 > A pretty little flower, no doubt; but we had never seen it. Could the poem have any meaning for us?   

Naipaul doesn't suggest that all imported literature is meaningless. Neither do I. Both Naipaul's world and mine have no campfire stories. Mythology that made the mundane hallowed. Therefore, for us, all literature was equally fantasy. My world seemed unimportant. A world where tanks rolled in when the communist government [fell][fallofdergue] in 1990. The world of a woman who traveled across the world, the Eat, Pray, Love world seemed more significant. This is not uncommon, the feeling of detachment from books. America teaches inner-city kids Flanders field; in urban jungles where neither poppies nor World War I veterans are seen. Kids who live in broken homes, learning about the glory of a war that is long gone. Fought between people who might as well be from King Arthur's roundtable. 

Naipaul's solution? To write about his world, examine it with the same seriousness that Joseph Conrad did for so many half-formed societies. My mindfulness had brought awareness. Awareness of birds, flowers and trees. All triggers for involuntary memories of my childhood. Yet, I didn't have the necessary symbols to relate them to the external body of literature. I could write about the beautiful flower that grew in my backyard. Yet, not connecting it to an external world that I knew existed, seemed foolish, arrogant even. So I took photos of them, then wrote about those photos. That helped. The photos helped me convey to myself, the world, the memory; in a way that was lost to me by not knowing the symbol: _daisy_.


Interestingly, the more pictures I took, the more I saw the relationship of photography to prose. I wrote primarily as a way of understanding my world. Now, I write to collaborate with the beholder; a beholder other than me. Similar, I hope will be the process of photography - telling more interesting stories around a fire. It is a tool that works very different from the written word, no doubt. Especially, because of the fickle nature of the eye. In school, I learnt about human perception. Unlike a scanner, the eye focuses randomly on interesting things. Some that mean more to the mind than the other. The challenge is to force the eyes to understand the artist's vision. [Barnbaum][barnbaumamz]'s quote on composing a good photo is pertinent. 

> Good composition is the artist's way of directing the viewer's vision in a planned, de-randomized fashion. 

Let us see where this goes. For now, here is a sample of the summer of my world.
