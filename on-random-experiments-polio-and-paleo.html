    <p><span class="newthought">In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006117758X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=006117758X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meditations02-20">Ham on Rye</a></span>, Bukowski talks about his acne. A teenager with acne has a
terrible fate. This was depression era America. Bukowski was poor. He went to a
hospital, I imagine one for poor people. The doctors suggested the electric
needle. A hot needle was used to drill his boils, squeeze them. This was done
for weeks. It was useless. He was left&nbsp;scarred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They experimented on the poor and if that worked they used the treatment on
the rich. And if it didn&#8217;t work, there would still be more poor left over to
experiment&nbsp;upon. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bukowski is an ugly man. Scarred in his photos. The story could be real. I
don&#8217;t know. However, humans are powerfully susceptible to anecdotes. Suppose the story was
true. Does the fact that the treatment failed mean it wouldn&#8217;t work for the
chosen few, the rich? Suppose it had succeeded, would it still work for rich&nbsp;people?  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Maybe he didn&#8217;t have acne. Maybe he got sick from the cans of
free hash they got. Maybe he lived in a polluted neighborhood. Maybe Bukowski,
as he said it, was just <em>selected</em> to have Acne. I don&#8217;t know. Anatole France
was however&nbsp;right. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To die for an idea is to set a rather high price on&nbsp;conjecture.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, conjecture is all we have. How do we reduce the number that die
then? It is hard. There is an art to it. An art of making numerical
conjectures: Statistics<label for="freedman"

        <input type="checkbox" id="freedman" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393929728/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393929728&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meditations02-20">Freedman</a>, anyway.</span>.</p>
<p>Say I have a bag of marbles. They are identical. Blue, round, made in the same
sweatshop. I sell them in a shop. An angry customer comes by. She was in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_(toy)#Marbles_games">ringer</a> competition in Alaska. Her marble cracked; due to the cold,
she says. Her life is ruined. She wants to sue. One way to find out for sure
what happened is to run an experiment. I could take a marble, fly to Alaska,
see if it cracks. What if I cheat? Choose a good marble. We decide the marble
will be chosen randomly. Since I may keep the marble in a marble cozy, someone
else who doesn&#8217;t know about the experiment will take it to Alaska. What if the
marble does crack? Does that mean it was the cold? Some marbles could just
crack. Maybe a bad batch from the sweatshop. Maybe some of the marbles collided
when the truck carrying them ran over a pothole. So we pick some marbles at
random. We flip a coin; separate the marbles into two groups. Now, the
probability that a marble cracks due to some other reason should be the same in
both groups. We fly one to Alaska; the other we keep here. A randomized
controlled&nbsp;experiment. </p>
<p>That was hard. It gets harder, especially when human lives are involved. Twenty
years after Bukowski&#8217;s tryst with Acne, Polio, the disease that left Roosevelt
crippled had a possible vaccine. Lab experiments looked optimistic. Again,
another conjecture was needed. One way of testing this conclusively is to
innoculate everyone. Compare against a previous year. Historical controls, they
are called. The problem was that this could be a good year or a really bad year for Polio. Can we 
compare children whose parents give vaccination permission against those who did not? 
Not quite. The poor are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis">healthy</a>. The rich are typically educated, more
willing to be vaccinated. An ideal experiment is one which picks children whose
parents allow them to be vaccinated. Those children are split into two groups.
One is vaccinated. Other is given a placebo. This was what was finally done. A
controversial experiment with tough ethical issues to&nbsp;solve.   </p>
<p>What of experiments where the researcher can&#8217;t play god? After all, not many
are willing to engage in a dangerous activity long term just to make a statistician
happy. So we run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study">observational studies</a>. Compare groups that are as identical as
possible. Male smokers in the age of 40-50 against male non-smokers in the same
age group. It is not easy. It is not&nbsp;perfect.   </p>
<p>It also explains why nutrition today is such a clusterfuck. My friends are into paleo. 
Everyone tells me anecdotes about hunter-gatherer civilizations and how they
were healthy. It is not clear how long they lived. Whether their behavioral
patterns were identical to the modern day hipster. Another danger is to
interpret too much from animal trials. Our society is fascinated by the lives
of mice and fruitflies. Probably more than cats. Today&#8217;s <span class="caps">BBC</span> news
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23490410">article</a> is relevant. They talked about the long
lives of male mice that were on diabetes pills. No clinical studies on humans,
yet. Just like a pack of cigarettes with a warning hidden somewhere, they said
at the very&nbsp;end:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is unclear what the study might mean for human&nbsp;health.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, the article was in the health section and not in the wildlife&nbsp;section.  </p>
<p>I wrote this in the <span class="caps">UCSF</span> medical library, Parnassus. The medical nature of
this article was probably not&nbsp;causal. </p>
