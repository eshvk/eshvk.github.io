    <p>Alfred Korzybski said that. Reality is not the model. The model however can
change. It can be changed. I realized that very recently. It is a powerful
idea. It directs responsibility inwards, completely. I am responsible for my
emotions, my reactions to the external&nbsp;world.   </p>
<p>We collaborate through models. Your model interacting with mine. In
relationships, art, cooperative learning etc. We see this in art specially.
Eric Kandel <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/opinion/sunday/what-the-brain-can-tell-us-about-art.html">talks</a> about the share of the beholder. The beholder&#8217;s brain acts as
a &#8216;creativity machine&#8217;. Each such interaction is different. This makes sense to
me. My neuroscience professor talked about this in visual perception. The data
stream fed into the eyes is mostly stripped. Some hints go to the brain. It
reconstructs it. It is an amazing idea. We all have a collaborative social
agreement on symbols to describe &#8216;red&#8217;. However, do we all perceive <span style="color: red;">red</span> the same&nbsp;way?   </p>
<p>Some models are more powerful, I feel. Prose is more effective at bringing
magical worlds across time and space. Movies, not so&nbsp;much.  </p>
<p>This is true in creating using computers. I spent quite a bit of time to make this site easy on my eyes; I am not satisfied with the end
result though. Yet, this is one of the best of the worst ways of doing this. <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret</a> Victor 
<a href="http://vimeo.com/66085662">talks</a> about programming being a &#8216;blindly manipulative task&#8217;. I agree. It is
apparent when I want to change colors in this blog. Ideally, I could get a
crayon, paint maybe. Paint on the mockup. The mockup would be turned into code.
I could deploy the code. Instead, I pick a color from a color picker. Change
the color in <span class="caps">SASS</span>. Regenerate the blog. See how it looks. Redo. Another
analogy? Fonts. I can write in my handwriting. Unique to me. Yet online, I pick
a font that is closest to what I want. I put the font in my blog. I see how it
looks. I repeat. The model is not completely bad. It lets me connect with
someone across the world. However, it is not good either. A newsletter using a
pen, would be more easy to&nbsp;use. </p>
<p>Bret has another analogy that applies to data science. When you want to
visualize data, say in R or Matlab. You put your data in it. The program builds
a bar chart or a pie chart or something from a template. Yet, when you write a
research paper, you don&#8217;t pick a template and fill in the&nbsp;blanks. </p>
<p>This is not to say that only old models are good. Mathematics is a great
example. I don&#8217;t like symbols. I don&#8217;t find numbers that interesting. I hate
silly problems about trains moving back and forth. Why is the mechanics of
moving locomotives supposed to be relevant to my life? Neither do I particularly
enjoy puzzles. Yet, I am deeply in love with math. You think Lolita works
on several different levels? Statistics is incredibly rich. A Gaussian
probability model underpins so many different narratives: Bayesian,
frequentist, even probability theory. These are not immediately apparent,
however. The symbols, even some of the drawings are limited. <em>Ceci n&#8217;est pas une
pipe</em>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">indeed</a>. </p>
<p>I was lucky. I found someone who stripped away symbols, shared with me their 
way of perceiving math. There needs to be a more systematic way of doing
this. How? I don&#8217;t know yet. I want to find out. I want to build better maps. I
want to use old maps more effectively. So I meditate on Math, Art and&nbsp;Prose. </p>
